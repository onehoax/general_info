- [JBoss EAP (Enterprise Application Platform)](https://developers.redhat.com/products/eap/overview)

  - JBoss EAP combines the familiar and popular Jakarta EE specifications with the latest technologies, like Eclipse MicroProfile, to modernize your applications from traditional Java EE into the new world of DevOps, cloud, containers, and microservices. JBoss EAP includes everything needed to build, run, deploy, and manage enterprise Java applications in a variety of environments, including on-premise, virtual environments, and in private, public, and hybrid clouds.

- Jakarta EE, formerly Java Platform, Enterprise Edition and Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition, is a set of specifications, extending Java SE with specifications for enterprise features such as distributed computing and web services

- WebSphere Application Server is a software product that performs the role of a web application server. More specifically, it is a software framework and middleware that hosts Java-based web applications. It is the flagship product within IBM's WebSphere software suite
  - Perhaps the biggest difference between WebSphere and Tomcat is the fact that while Tomcat is an open source project managed by the Apache Software Foundation, the WebSphere Application Server is a commercial product backed by IBM
- Apache Tomcat is a free and open-source implementation of the Jakarta Servlet specification. It provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment in which Java code can also run. Thus it is a Java web application server, although not a full JEE application server
- A Jakarta Servlet, formerly Java Servlet is a Java software component that extends the capabilities of a server. Although servlets can respond to many types of requests, they most commonly implement web containers for hosting web applications on web servers and thus qualify as a server-side servlet web API

- Microservices architecture is an architectural pattern that arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled, fine-grained services, communicating through lightweight protocols

- Apache NiFi is a software project from the Apache Software Foundation designed to automate the flow of data between software systems

- Apache Hadoop is a collection of open-source software utilities that facilitates using a network of many computers to solve problems involving massive amounts of data and computation. It provides a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data using the MapReduce programming model.
