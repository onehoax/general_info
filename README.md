- [JBoss EAP (Enterprise Application Platform)](https://developers.redhat.com/products/eap/overview)

- Jakarta EE, formerly Java Platform, Enterprise Edition and Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition, is a set of specifications, extending Java SE with specifications for enterprise features such as distributed computing and web services

- WebSphere Application Server is a software product that performs the role of a web application server. More specifically, it is a software framework and middleware that hosts Java-based web applications. It is the flagship product within IBM's WebSphere software suite
  - Perhaps the biggest difference between WebSphere and Tomcat is the fact that while Tomcat is an open source project managed by the Apache Software Foundation, the WebSphere Application Server is a commercial product backed by IBM
- Apache Tomcat is a free and open-source implementation of the Jakarta Servlet specification. It provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment in which Java code can also run. Thus it is a Java web application server, although not a full JEE application server
- A Jakarta Servlet, formerly Java Servlet is a Java software component that extends the capabilities of a server. Although servlets can respond to many types of requests, they most commonly implement web containers for hosting web applications on web servers and thus qualify as a server-side servlet web API
